You are building a production-grade CAMPUS REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM.

Core objective:
Enforce time-bound reimbursements through SLA tracking, escalation, and transparency.

Primary principles:
- Every reimbursement must have a responsible role and department
- Every reimbursement must have an SLA
- Time cannot be paused or reset manually
- Delays must be visible and measurable
- Escalations must be automatic and logged
- Audit logs are immutable

Target users:
- Student (claimant)
- Department Approver
- Accounts Officer
- Escalation Authority
- Super Admin (oversight only)

Constraints:
- No payment disbursement
- No ERP replacement
- No manual SLA override
- No UI-driven truth
- Server-side timestamps only

This system is designed for realism, governance transparency, and measurable administrative impact.
